# Analyzing Bounce Rates and Conversions

## üìä Project Overview

This project explores user behavior on a website by analyzing bounce rates, conversion metrics, and traffic sources using R. By examining how different traffic sources and user interactions impact conversion rates, the goal is to uncover actionable insights that can improve marketing effectiveness and website performance.

Bounce rate is a critical metric that reflects user engagement, and understanding its correlation with other variables like session duration, traffic source, and conversion rate helps stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

## üéØ Objectives

- Analyze website traffic data to identify trends and patterns in bounce rates and conversions.
- Perform data preprocessing and handle missing values.
- Visualize bounce rate distribution, traffic source effectiveness, and conversion behavior.
- Use correlation analysis to uncover relationships between numeric metrics.
- Offer recommendations based on insights derived from the analysis.

## üìÅ Dataset Description

The dataset used (`website_wata.csv`) contains various website analytics metrics. Key columns include:

- `Traffic.Source`: The source from which users arrived (e.g., Organic, Direct, Referral).
- `Bounce.Rate`: Percentage of visitors who leave after viewing only one page.
- `Conversion.Rate`: Percentage of visitors who completed a desired action (e.g., sign-up, purchase).
- Other numerical and categorical features reflecting user engagement, traffic volume, and session behavior.

## üß∞ Tools & Libraries Used

The project is implemented in **R** using the following libraries:

- `ggplot2`: For creating insightful data visualizations.
- `corrplot`: For visualizing correlation matrices.
- `caret`: For data preprocessing and transformation.

## üîç Methodology

1. **Data Import and Cleaning**
   - Read the CSV file into an R dataframe.
   - Handle missing values.
   - Convert categorical variables (like `Traffic.Source`) to factor types.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Generate summary statistics.
   - Visualize distributions of bounce rate and conversion rate.
   - Explore how different traffic sources affect user engagement.

3. **Correlation Analysis**
   - Calculate and visualize the correlation matrix of numeric variables.
   - Identify strong or negative correlations that influence conversion.

4. **Insights and Interpretation**
   - Discover key drivers of bounce rates and conversions.
   - Understand the role of traffic sources in user engagement.

## üìà Sample Visualizations

- Histogram of bounce rates
- Boxplots comparing bounce/conversion rates across traffic sources
- Correlation heatmap showing relationships between key metrics
